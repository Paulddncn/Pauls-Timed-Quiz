# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

## About this project
Project Name: Paul's Timed Quiz

This project asks the user if they would like to start a timed quiz. Once the quiz begins the user will go through and select an answer out of multiple choices. If the user picks the wrong answer, 2 seconds are taken off the clock. The users final score is based off the amount of time remaining. At the end the user is able to enter their initials and save this information along with their score.


## User Story
